Disclaimer: This piece of ugly code is very specific to the system. Don't expect it to work out of
the box. It can be GREATLY optimized and SHOULD if it ever would be used in a production environment.

I made this as a free alternative to the product offered at http://www.wirelessautoswitch.com/.

The idea is to provide a service that automatically disable any Wireless connection when the
computer is connected to a LAN connection and vice versa.

Since I did not find any good way to detect disabled network adapters and identify them as wireless,
the service scans for a network adapter named "Wireless Network Connection" on the control panel
for network connections. If you have multiple Wireless or LAN connections this will be chosen randomly.

Wlanauto4 is a Windows Service. Install it by passing the -i switch to the program. It will not start
automatically after installation, though the service is configured to start automatically on boot.

The service will check if your LAN adapter is connected to any network every 3 seconds. If it isn't
connected the service will enable the Wireless adapter, and the other way around.
